    <h1>Sigma16 computer architecture</h1>

    <p> This is an integrated application for experimenting with
        computer architecture, assembly language programming, systems
        programming, and digital circuits.  The system contains a
        specification of the Sigma16 machine architecture, an
        assembler, a collection of example programs, a linker, an
        emulator, and a digital circuit implementation with
        simulator. </p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> The User Guide is shown beside the main application, so you
        can refer to it while working on a program.  It contains full
        documentation, including tutorials, details on the
        architecture, the assembly and machine languages, programming
        techniques, and how to use the software tools. </li>
      <li> You can adjust the size of the main application and the
        documentation.  There is a small resize handle at the bottom
        edge of the application, just to the left of the dividing line
        between the application and the documentation.  Drag this
        handle with the mouse button down to resize. </li>
      <li> If you don't see the documentation at all, try increasing
        the width of the browser window. </li>
      <li> The README.txt file gives general information. </li>
      <li> This is free software; see LICENSE.txt for details. </li>
      <li> To get started, work through *Tutorial: Run an example
        program* (see the Table of Contents). </li>
