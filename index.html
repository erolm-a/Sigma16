    <h1> Sigma16 </h1>
    <p> Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and
      teaching in computer systems.  This application provides a
      complete environment for experimenting with the architecture,
      including an editor, assembler, linker, emulator, and an
      integrated development environment.  There is a digital circuit
      that implements the architecture, which is specified using the
      Hydra functional hardware description language.  Hydra can
      simulate the circuit, and machine language programs can run on
      both the emulator and the circuit. </p>

    <p> Quick start: launch <b> Sigma16.exe </b> and visit
      <b> <a href="http://localhost:8023">
          http://localhost:8023 </a> </b> in your browser. </p>

    <h3> Running the application </h3>
    <p> You need to start two programs: the Sigma16 application, and a
      web browser.  The application runs as an independent process,
      and it uses the browser to display the graphical user interface.
      The software runs on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux, and
      currently it works with Chrome and Firefox.  Unzip the
      installation file and enter the directory.  To run the
      application you need to do two things: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Launch the program, using any one of the following
        methods: </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Run the executable file: click <b> Sigma16.exe </b> </li>
        <li> If there is no executable file, run the program from
          source: enter <b>bash run</b> in a shell. (If you're using
          cygwin, then enter bash runcygwin.) </li>
        <li> You can compile the program. </li>
        <li> The program requires several files to be present, and it
        needs to be able to find them.  If it fails to find the
        required files, the symptom is that the GUI will repeatedly
        start, fail, and restart. </li>
        <li> See Installing the Software below, and the User Guide,
        for more details. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Open the GUI in a browser. </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Visit the following address in your browser, either
        Chrome or Firefox:
          <a href="http://localhost:8023">
            http://localhost:8023 </a> </li>
        <li> If you get an error on your browser, something like
          <em> This site can't be reached, localhost refused to
            connect</em>, that means the program isn't running.
          Launch it and the web page should connect. </li>
        <li> The application assumes a fairly wide browser window, and
          it displays the User Guide to the right of the architecture
          display.  If the browser window isn't wide enough, the
          documentation will not be visible. </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3> Documentation </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> The User Guide is displayed in the running
        application </li>
      <li> Without launching the program, you can read the User Guide
        as <a href="datafiles/doc/html/index.html"> html </a> or
        alternatively as <a href="src/docsrc/index.txt"> plain
        text </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Using the software </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <em> Refreshing. </em> The processor pane has a Refresh
      button which redraws the display.  If you refresh the browser
      window (a little circle with an arrow beside the URL entry),
      this will restart the application, which is probably not what
      you want. </li>
      <li> <em> Finding your files. </em> The best place to keep your
        assembly language programs is in the Documents folder.  Create
        a folder in your Documents directory called Sigma16programs,
        and save your programs there.  Then when you launch Sigma16,
        go to the editor pane, click Open, and in the Open dialogue
        click Documents.  It should show a list of directories
        including Sigma16programs; click that and then the exercise
        file, then click Open Selected File.  Let me know if it works,
        or if you're still having problems. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Installing the software </h3>
    <p> The Sigma16 directory may be either a <em>source
        distribution</em> or a <em>compiled distribution</em>
      (sometimes called a "binary"). </p>

    <ul>
      <li> A compiled distribution contains an executable program.  On
        Windows this is Sigma16.exe.  You can run the application by
        launching that executable file. For this to work, the
        executable needs to be the right kind for your operating
        system. </li>
      <li> If you don't have an executable program, or if it doesn't
        match your operating system, you can run the application from
        the source. </li>
      <li> There are two ways to run Sigma16 from a source
        distribution: you can compile it (using ghc), or you can run
        it from the source program (using ghci).  Either way, you need
        to have the Haskell Platform installed, and it needs to be the
        May 2016 release (containing compiler version ghc-8.0.1).
        This is available
        from <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/prior.html">
        https://www.haskell.org/platform/prior.html </a> </li>
      <li> The program can be compiled using the following commands:
        <pre>
          ghc --version      (should be 8.0.1)
          cabal update
          cabal configure
          cabal build
          cabal install
          Sigma16
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li> To run from source: open a shell and enter the command bash
        run (if you're using cygwin on Windows, enter bash
        runcygwin). It will run more slowly than a compiled version
        but is likely to be fast enough. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
